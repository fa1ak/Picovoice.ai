Question:
The probability of rain on a given calendar day in Vancouver is p[i], where i is the day's index. 
For example, p[0] is the probability of rain on January 1st, and p[10] is the probability of precipitation on January 11th. 
Assume the year has 365 days (i.e., p has 365 elements). What is the chance it rains more than n (e.g., 100) days in Vancouver?
Write a function that accepts p (probabilities of rain on a given calendar day) and n as input arguments 
and returns the possibility of raining at least n days.
